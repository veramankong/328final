 Air duct cleaning is performed under negative air pressure from a gas powered vacuum. Air whip agitation is supplied through out every vent to remove harmful dust, pollen, and bacteria so the vacuum supplying pressure can safely remove the material into containment bags. Its recommended by NADCA (National Air Duct Cleaning Association) to have your vents cleaned every 4 years or as often as a home owner wishes.
